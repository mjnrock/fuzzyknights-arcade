**	Event Invocation, Listener Processing
**			Proof of Concept
[]	Make xEntityEvent
[]	Make Corresponding xEntityEventMessage
[]	Send Message
[]	Dispatch Message to Entity Handler
[]	ReceiveMessage
[]	ProcessMessage
[]	Invoke xEntityEvent from xEntityEventMessage
[]	EntityManager has listener via Registry of xEntityEvents
[]	Does work based on the event


**	Message Sender Attributions
[]	Add UUID to the Client's Server.WebSocket
[]	Send UUID to Client from Server for syncing
[]	Add { Sender: "SERVER" } as when from Server
[]	Add { Sender: Client's UUID } as when from Client
